iburg is written in and generates ANSI C and thus must be compiled with
an ANSI C compiler and preprocessor, e.g., gcc or lcc. To compile
iburg, type "make". There should be no warnings or errors (except
perhaps in the system-dependent YACC skeleton).

sample.brg is from the paper in burg.ps, sample4.brg is from the paper
in iburg.ps, and sample5.brg is an example from a compilers course.
"make test" runs iburg on sample[45].brg and executes the resulting
programs. The output should be something like:

% make test
./iburg -I sample4.brg sample4.c; cc -o test4 sample4.c; ./test4
sample4.c
i = c + 4;
stmt: ASGNI(disp,reg)
 disp: ADDRLP
 reg: disp
  disp: ADDI(reg,con)
   reg: CVCI(INDIRC(disp))
    disp: ADDRLP
   con: CNSTI
./iburg -I sample5.brg sample5.c; cc -o test5 sample5.c; ./test5
sample5.c
stm: MOVE(MEM(loc),reg)
 loc: NAME
 reg: PLUS(MEM(loc),reg)
  loc: PLUS(NAME,reg)
   reg: MEM(loc)
    loc: NAME
  reg: con
   con: CONST

To install iburg, copy it and its man page to the appropriate local
directories, e.g., on UNIX:

% cp iburg /usr/local
% cp iburg.1 /usr/local/man/man1

"make clobber" removes the executables and all derived files except
gram.c; "make clean" removes just object, core, and sample*.c files.

To be added to the iburg mailing list, which announces new versions,
etc., send a message with the 1-line body

subscribe iburg

to majordomo@cs.princeton.edu. This line must appear in the message
body; `Subject:' lines are ignored.

Mail bug reports along with the shortest input that exposes them to
drh@microsoft.com.
